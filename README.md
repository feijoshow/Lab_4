What This Project Is About
This is a simple, user-friendly registration form where you can add student details like their name, email, programme, year, interests, and a photo. The form checks your input live — so you get quick feedback if you forget something or enter the wrong email format.

Once you submit, the information creates a neat profile card showing the student’s details and a photo you upload from your computer. It also adds a corresponding row in a summary table below. You can remove any student entry, and the card and table update instantly.

How to Use It
Just unzip all the files (or keep them together in one folder) and open the index.html file in your favorite browser — no need to install anything or run a server. It works right away offline!

Just fill in the form, upload a photo, and submit. Profiles will stack up as cards on the page, and the table reflects what’s there with a remove button for each entry.

Notes & Extras
The photo upload uses your browser to display the picture immediately and doesn’t send anything over the internet, so it’s safe and fast.

There’s inline validation to help avoid mistakes without interrupting your flow.

The design follows accessibility best practices to be easy to use for everyone, including keyboard navigation and screen readers.
